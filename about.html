	    Big Butts Corp. Founder, Carla Lopez
	    </p>
	    <p class="centered">Big Butts Corporation, the one person company, was founded in 2002 by Carla Lopez in Rockdale, Illinois. Completely by coincidence, she has also been the top Big Butts Corp. model every month since the company's inception. Carla has been hand picked by the company's founder to appear on the cover of every issue of Big Butts Corp. magazine.
		</p>
		<p class="centered">
		It all began one day when Carla realized that she had large growths on her posterior end. She knew she could use this to become very successful. Carla began by posting photographs of her tuchus on social media, such as Xanga and MySpace. She instantly became popular and well respected by all. Since then, Big Butts Corp. has only continued to grow.
